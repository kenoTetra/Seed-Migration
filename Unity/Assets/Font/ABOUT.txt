This font was made mostly for my comic strips*. That's why character base is 
very limited and font have line/character spacing issues. If you want to help me
in fixing that, I'd be grateful. This font is basically my handwritting. I'm not
a font-maker. It was rather proof of concept of my chain of tools for generating
fonts.

The name is a wordplay on Adderall - a drug that contains amphetamines. The 
reason to give such name is that I used fast and aggressive strokes.

If you need different characters, I can do it, as long as they will be some 
diacritics, single symbols etc.

I hope you'd find some use for it. If you used it in your project, I'd be 
grateful if you'd notice me by e-mail: addex@krzysiu.net - it's not required,
but I like to know that my FLOSS stuff is actually used by somebody.

I used following software:
* Gimp - basic processing of scan of characters
* Inkscape - vectorizing glyphs
* FontForge - turning vector files into glyphs
* Own PHP/Python scripts for automatic 1) conversion of one file in one file per
  glyph; 2) importing separate files into single font project

Manifesto: Stop the Windows vs. *nix vs. Mac hate

I used both Windows and Linux - to create this font I needed to do a lot of 
tasks. Some were more comfortable to me when I was using Windows, some when 
Linux. Maybe I'd use Mac in addition, but I haven't one. Still, it's all about 
our choice. Please, stop the hate-speech and aggression against users of other 
operating systems.
